A BETTER NAME PLEASE

Modes:
Fire and Ice Ball Powerups (fast and slow, or fast ball and slow or frozen paddle once ball makes contact)
Swap Paddle Position (maybe, too OP), Smash (hit the ball really hard), Uncontrollable Speed for Opponent, Time Warp (slow down time except for yourself, in progress) press enter to activate, 7 second cooldown
Color Match (ball switches between 4 colors randomly when it enters the center, players must press enter to change paddle color to matching color, otherwise point is lost, regular rules also apply)
Teleportation Mode (click to teleport paddle to any desired location on your side of the field when cooldown finishes)
Gravity + Gravity Flipping
