# 1 Priority:
A BETTER NAME PLEASE

Modes:
Fire and Ice Ball Powerups (fast and slow, or fast ball and slow or frozen paddle once ball makes contact)
Swap Paddle Position (maybe, too OP), Smash (hit the ball really hard), Uncontrollable Speed for Opponent, Time Warp (slow down time except for yourself, in progress) press enter to activate, 7 second cooldown
Color Match (ball switches between 4 colors randomly when it enters the center, players must press enter to change paddle color to matching color, otherwise point is lost, regular rules also apply)
Teleportation Mode (click to teleport paddle to any desired location on your side of the field when cooldown finishes)
Gravity + Gravity Flipping

Also, I'm noticing the Black Holes mode can get a bit framey at times.

A few modes (e.g. the lag and time modes) use list based timers (every tick append an item to a list, if the length 
of that list exceeds 60 * number_of_seconds_for_event then you clear the list and perform some action.
Is there any better way to accomplish this?

Player Customization (my last priority in the universe might get bumped up soon just so that the players can tell the difference between each paddle)
